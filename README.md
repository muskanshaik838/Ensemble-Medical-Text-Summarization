# 🧠 Ensemble Medical Text Summarization using NLP Models

This project performs **automatic summarization of medical texts** using an ensemble of **state-of-the-art NLP models** (e.g., BART & PEGASUS). The goal is to generate concise and meaningful summaries from long medical documents such as research articles or clinical notes.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Summarizes long medical texts into shorter, readable summaries.
- Combines multiple NLP models (ensemble approach) to improve accuracy.
- Can handle different types of medical documents.
- Built with Python and popular NLP libraries.
